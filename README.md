Engineer Abe — Data Engineering Journey
I am a Computer Engineering student building my foundation in Data Engineering through structured learning in Python, data structures, and data processing.
This repository documents my progress in:
Python fundamentals
Core data structures (List, Set, Dictionary, Tuple)
Algorithms and Big-O basics
File handling (CSV, JSON)
Basic ETL logic (Extract, Transform, Load)
My goal is to understand how data flows inside systems and to build efficient, scalable data pipelines in the future.
